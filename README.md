# OOP-in-python
**Introduction**: This repository is designed to help beginners learn Python’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features in a clear, step-by-step way. It contains simple examples and explanations for core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism (as well as a small ATM project). Object-oriented programming lets you bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into reusable units (objects).

**Overview**: Each concept in this repository is explained in clear, beginner-friendly language, using bullet points and simple code examples. The repository is neatly organized by topic, making it easy to navigate.

For your convenience, each file includes a "Open in Google Colab" button in the top-right corner. Simply click it to launch and run the code directly in Google Colab—no local setup is needed.

Before every code section, you’ll find a short explanation of the concept being covered. This ensures that you understand the theory before diving into the practical example.

Whether you're new to programming or just starting with Python, this repository is designed to help you learn step-by-step with hands-on practice.
